e# MyProject Platform App

A simple, reusable Flutter application that displays a splash screen and opens a configurable URL in a full-screen in-app browser. This app works seamlessly across iOS, Android, and desktop platforms.

## Features

- **Splash Screen**: Displays your custom logo and app name
- **In-App Browser**: Opens web content in full-screen WebView
- **Easy Configuration**: Change URL, logo, and app name without rebuilding
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles network errors with retry functionality
- **Pull to Refresh**: Users can refresh the web content

## Configuration

All app settings are stored in local files that can be easily modified:

### 1. Change URL and App Name

Edit `assets/config.json`:

```json
{
  "appName": "myproject",
  "url": "https://myprojectplatform.com"
}
```

### 2. Change Logo

Replace the logo file at:
```
assets/images/logo.png
```

After replacing the logo, update the reference in `pubspec.yaml` if the filename changes:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/config.json
    - assets/images/YOUR_NEW_LOGO_FILENAME.png
```

### 3. Change App Display Name

**For Android**: Edit `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
```xml
<application android:label="Your App Name" ...>
```

**For iOS**: Edit `ios/Runner/Info.plist`
```xml
<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
<string>Your App Name</string>
```
